/* java file exectutes in 5 steps. First of all what we write in notepad or
   text editor is known as a source code. Later on when we run that file,
   Java Compiler known as javac compiles it and makes a class file of that
   file. On that time, the class file is known as byte file. The byte file
   is machine readable. Humans cannot read that file. Lastly, that byte file
   gets executed.
